# Task 01

You have to develop the UI as shown below on the right and add your name in place of Amanda text part and “aka Flutter developer” in UI/UX designer text part before making the submission.

- **Fork repo and start working** : The starter dart file ([day_3_starter.dart](https://github.com/swciitg/flutter_workshop_2022/blob/main/Day_3/day_3_starter.dart)) contains structure for the layout of actual design. Fork the repo and then, clone it in your system. Copy & paste the code of starter dart file in new flutter project’s main.dart and start building the UI.
- **Add your work to cloned repo** : Try to make the design as close as you can to the actual design. For the submission, rename your main.dart to “your_name_rollno_main.dart” and copy & paste this file to cloned repo folder.
- **Make the submission**: Commit your changes, push code to your forked repo and raise a pull request.
